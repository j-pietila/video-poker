# Jokeripokeri - Legendary RAY video poker game

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

If you were living in Finland during the late 80's or 90's you are probably very familiar
with this game. The Jokeripokeri machines were abundant in every market, fuel station,
bar and restaurant. More than once the coins in our pockets got eaten up by one of these
instead of buying candy as a kid growing up in the 90's. Then again, sometimes it was the
lucky day and the candy was flowing after one of these spit up a shower of coins into its
metal money slot after hitting a couple of really good doubling rounds. Yeah, age restrictions
for gambling weren't taken as seriously in the 90's Finland as they are nowadays.  

This version of Jokeripokeri is created with Python using its core library GUI framework tkinter
and Python Imaging Library (PIL). Of course tkinter isn't really made for doing responsive interfaces for games,
but hey, if you can make it work, and learn the framework at the same time, then why not?

## Features to be implemented
- Adding proper animations for the playing cards
- Adding game sounds
- Package and make it playable remotely over the internet
